# portfolio
This is my webdev portfolio to show that I am, indeed, a React Developer. Talk is cheap in the coding world isn't it.

This will showcase all of my various projects, contributions to corporations/startups I've worked for, as well as give an overview as to who I am, what my skills are, and what my philosophy is in regards to my approach to coding. Enjoy
